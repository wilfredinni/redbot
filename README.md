# uselessBot

A useless robot that goes where you want

## How does it work

In Twitter, just use @

- Fill the credential.json with your API keys for Reddit and Twitter.
- Open or Import retwibot.py and use search() with a subreddit:

    ```python
    search('learnpython')
    ```

The script will search every 60 seconds for new entries in the subreddit and every time it finds a new one, it will post it on Twitter.

You can see it working at [@retwyBot](https://twitter.com/retwyBot) and running thanks to [pythonanywhere.com](https://www.pythonanywhere.com).
